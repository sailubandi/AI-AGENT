It prioritizes consistent progress and incorporates feedback mechanisms.\n\n**Key Improvements:**\n\n* **Realistic Pacing:**  The original plan was ambitious. This revised version allows for more focused study on each topic, incorporating more realistic time estimates.\n* **Integrated Review and Practice:** Regular review and practice sessions are built-in to reinforce learning and prevent knowledge decay.\n* **Targeted Practice:** The plan specifies platforms (LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks) for coding practice and encourages the use of relevant libraries (scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch).\n* **Burnout Prevention:**  More rest days and mindful breaks are strategically placed to prevent burnout.\n* **Goal Alignment:** The plan directly connects daily studies to the skills required for a 40 LPA tech job, focusing on in-demand areas like DSA, AI/ML, and Cybersecurity.\n\n\n**Week 1: Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) Fundamentals (7 Days)**\n\n| Day | Date       | Topic                     | Activities                                                                        | Time Allocation | Review/Practice | Focus Tip                                     | Motivational Quote                                         |\n|-----|------------|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1   | Oct 26    | Introduction to DSA     | Read relevant materials, understand Big O notation.                               | 2 hours         | 30 mins          | Pomodoro Technique                             | \"The only way to do great work is to love what you do.\" - Steve Jobs |\n| 2   | Oct 27    | Arrays & Linked Lists     | Code problems on LeetCode/GeeksforGeeks (focus on efficiency).                    | 3 hours         | 1 hour           | Time Blocking                                     | \"Success is not final, failure is not fatal...\" - Winston Churchill |\n| 3   | Oct 28    | Stacks & Queues          | Code problems on LeetCode/GeeksforGeeks.                                         | 2.5 hours        | 45 mins          | Minimize Distractions                           | \"The only limit to our realization...\" - Franklin D.
